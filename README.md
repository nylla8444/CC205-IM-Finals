# INSTRUCTIONS

### Prerequisites
- **git** (for cloning git repository)
- **VSCode**
- **XAMPP** (for SQL server)

# 

### If you prefer a Youtube Video, see this [MySQL Database to Visual Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9ngotJz1w) video

#
### XAMPP Setup 
Open you XAMPP and Start **Apache** and **MySQL**:  

![XAMPP](./public/xampp.jpg)  

Go to VSCode if it is already good and running.  

#
### VSCode Setup
Open your VSCode and go to `Extensions`:  

![Extension](./public/extension.jpg)


In the Search Bar type "**SQL**" and then find this (below) and install:  

![SQL](./public/SQL.jpg)

You are all good for now. Let's continue...   
#


### Database Connection
After installing the Extension you should see this in your left side bar:  

![connection](./public/connection.jpg)

Click **Create Connection**

**Clicking will trigger this configuration to appear:**  

![connect-server](./public/connect-server.jpg)

You can just follow everything in the image.

**After that you should be able to see something like this:**  

![connected](./public/connected.jpg)  ![expand](./public/expand.jpg)  
*this displays the available databases in your XAMPP. To create new database just hover the server name (in the image is local_strayspot), you should be able to see a plus icon.*

> [!NOTE]  
> See the expanded database **strayspot**. Please be familiar with the Query and Tables (as you can see in the image above).

#
### Clone the Repository

**CREATE TABLE** commands are inside **`TABLE`** folder\
**INSERT INTO** commands are inside  **`DATA`** folder
 
**SQL Queries** are inside **`GET`** folder\
*GET because we are getting something from our DB*
